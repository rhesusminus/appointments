## appointments
Just a training application to try out different frameworks, libraries, etc.

I guess it's going to be a somekinda application where user can make appointments.

Client: React, Redux, react-router, etc.

Server: Node.js, express, ...

## usage
Clone the repo and do `npm install` in the client and the server folders. Run `nm run dev` in the server-folder and `npm run start` in the client-folder to start developmenting or testing.
